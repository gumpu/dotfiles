#Dot Files

This is my collection of dotfiles plus some tools to install them in the
correct place. I have tried to document why I chose each setting.

#Context

I am a software developer with a love for data science. I prefer to to as much
as possible from the command line.  The main tools I use are:

- Vim
- Python
- R
- C
- git
- task
- ssh
- tmux


This on Arch Linux with i3 as Window Manager.
